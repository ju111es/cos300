Hello :) I am very interested in Russian and I found most online resources for practicing it too easy or too short. Luckily, I am also very interested in programming :) so I used Tkinter to create an app in which a user can practice all five of the Russian grammatical cases (excluding the nominative/default case, which makes six total), as well as practicing verb conjugation in present and past tense and recognizing and applying when a verb will undergo consonant mutation, as well as access concise but informative lessons (written by me) about each of these concepts. The program can recognize some common mistakes and correct them with explanations. It randomizes pronouns before verbs and plurality of nouns each time any given mode is opened so that a user can practice all of the different forms of each word in the program. The app, currently called simply "Русские Упражения" ("Russian Exercises"), took me about three months to complete. It is currently not exportable in .exe format, but can be accessed by running my code.
